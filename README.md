Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile. <br>
Recommendation systems are beneficial to both users and providers. <br>
In this project we are building a recommendation system/model that will recommend us restaurants in a particular destination taking in your longitude and latitude geographic location. <br>

# Details of the project. <br>
We will be taking in our dataset and train our model according to reviews it has and its location using K mean clustering. <br>
We will also see how to portray geographical data onto google colab notebook using plotly libraries (and geo pandas) and more.<br>
Lastly we will build function that will take geographical data as input  and recommend restaurants to the users.

# Machine Learning Model <br>
We will start off with building a machine learning model using K-Means clustering model and train that model using the dataset. For this project, you will have to understand all the libraries are used before implementing the code. <br>

# Types of Recommendation system
There are mainly two types of recommendation system and a hybrid of these two types. <br>
1) Content based filtering: It makes recommendation based on users preferences, for product features. <br>
2) Collaborative filtering: It mimic user to user recommendation.
