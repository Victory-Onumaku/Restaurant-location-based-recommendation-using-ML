# Restaurant-location-based-recommendation-system-using-ML

Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile. <br>
Recommendation systems are beneficial to both users and providers.
In this project we are building a recommendation system/model that will recommend us restaurants in a particular destination taking in your longitude and latitude geographic location.
